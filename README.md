# Leuk-OS

This is a learning repository, in order to keep track on the things I learn while searching about OS-dev

If there is enough (and if I can), I will open another repository for learning and explaining OS-deving to anyone who wants to learn like me.

Meanwhile, check out wiki.osdev.org and don't be afraid to try.
